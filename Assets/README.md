## 9. **Design Patterns & Architecture**

- **SOLID Principles**:
  - Where and how they are applied (single responsibility, open/closed, etc.).
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
  - Example: managing game services and managers.
- **Pooling System**:
  - Example: bullets, enemies, pickups for performance.
- **Builder & Factory Patterns**:
  - Example: level creation, enemy instantiation.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**:
  - Example: separating logic from UI, player/enemy controllers.
- **Async & Tasks**:
  - Example: timers, respawn logic, game events.
- **Template Pattern**:
  - Used for common behaviors in enemies, pickups, etc.
